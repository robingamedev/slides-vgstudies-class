# The Cost of Gaming

[col]
- In the 1990s, gaming was a risk. Games were expensive.  
- You either bought games as they came out at your local Funcoland
- OR you bought lots of magazines (GamePros, Game Informers, Nintendo Power, Electronic Game Monthlys) to read about the games.

[/col]

[col]
- Today (30 years later), games have gotten much less expensive. 
- Discounts on games are common. 
- Emulation allows you to play classic games for free. 
- The average cost of gaming now sitting at roughly $0.80 per hour—compared to nearly $8.00 per hour for a night at the cinema 
- We're no longer afraid of wasting money. We're afraid of wasting attention.

In the 1990s, gaming was a risk. Games were expensive.

You were either really rich and just bought games as they came out at your local Funcoland (pre-Game Stop).
OR you were roaming around Blockbuster, and hoping what's on the shelf was good based on the box and 'demo-ing' for a fee, before you commit to buying it.

OR you were like me, you bought lots and lots of game magazines. The GamePros and Game Informers. The Nintendo Power. The Electronic Game Monthlys. And you read about everything to make sure the risk was minimized.

Over 30 years have gone by and the dust has settled. Gaming has gotten so cheap. 

And for a percentage of people, with the power of emulation and wearing a dope ass pirate hat, the average person literally has 10,000 games right in their hand without spending thousands of dollars. [expand with data - popular systems and how many games were released]

With the average cost of gaming now sitting at roughly $0.80 per hour—compared to nearly $8.00 per hour for a night at the cinema - we're no longer afraid of wasting money. We're afraid of wasting attention.

# How we discover games

[2-col]

[col]
Today, "The Algorithm" controls you. 
- **Influencers** on Twitch telling you what to play
- **Game Journalists** on blogs like Rock Paper Shotgun and Polygon
- **Game Curators** making recommendations
- **Storefronts** showing you what games are popular
[/col]

[col]
But they are also affected by "The Algorithm". 
- Twitch players (**Influencers**) get paid to play specific games, and lose viewers if they play other games.
- **Game Journalists** write for SEO. AAA games attracts eyeballs, not indie games.  
- **Game Curators** are unpaid and rely on the Discovery Feed. They only recommend what they find.
- **Storefronts** prioritize "relevance", not "quality". Giant ads and the Top Sellers chart are the main drivers of discovery.
[/col]

Today, the algorithm controls you. 
- influencers on Twitch telling you what to play
- Game Journalists on blogs like Rock Paper Shotgun and Polygon
- game curators making recommendations
- storefronts showing you what games are popular

But they are also affected by "The algorithm". 
- Twitch players get paid by Fortnite to play Fortnite. They try to introduce a new game, a lose a chunk of fans because people tuned into to watch them play Fortnite. That dropoff rate discourages them from exploring new games.
- Game Journalists are limited to by what they can cover. Their boss wants SEO-optimized content. Stories about AAA games is what attracts eyeballs, not indie games.  
- Game Curators are unpaid and rely on the Discovery Feed themselves to find new games. The curator recommending retro games may have only learned about it from 'the algorithm', which takes their recommendation to FEED 'the algorithm'.
- Storefronts prioritize "relevance", not "quality". From big giant ads, to games that are already selling well in the Top Sellers chart. This makes it hard for new indie games to be discovered.

# The Indie Renaissance

- Game development tooling allows anybody with a creative spirit to publish. 
- The 20,282 games were released in 2025 - 95% were not under a standard AAA company. And 9,893 were explicitly tagged as Indie (roughly 49% of all releases).
- With those numbers, is indie games shovelware or quick money grabs?

- Remember, these were indie games before they became popular:

[braindump]
We are in a new era where game development tooling allows anybody with a creative spirit to publish. We are in the era of Indie games.

And when phrased like that, it can look like heaps of shovelware or quick money grabs. A bunch of games that deserve to live next to Atari ET game in the landfill.

But I like to remind people:

- Minecraft was a indie game.
- Terrarria and Stardew Valley was a indie game.
- Hollow Knight, Undertale, Hades, Cuphead...
- Fez, Stray, Journey, Inscryption, Papers Please, Return of the Obra Dinn, The Stanley Parable, Disco Elysium.

"This weird painting by Van Gogh is actually brilliant." - some taste maker



[braindump]
"In art history, the process of a 'masterpiece' entering the cultural record is called Canonization. It’s rarely the result of a massive marketing budget or a big corporation that does this.

Van Gogh: he didn't become a household name because of an algorithm. He became a legend because of his peers who recognized his genius that the general public (plebs) was blind to.

# History is Written by the Victors
- As Video Game Studies students, we are at the forefront of gaming.
- We can be the pioneers who separate the treasures from the trash, elevating the games. 
- We are defining where culture is born.
- We are the taste makers who recommends the next Hollow Knight, the next Hades, the next Stardew Valley.

[braindump]
As Video Game Studies students, we are at the forefront of gaming.

History is written by the victors, but don't let it be soley written by the Algorithm. We can be the pioneers who separate the treasures from the trash, elevating the games. We are defining where culture is born.

You can be the taste maker who recommends the next Hollow Knight, the next Hades, the next Stardew Valley.

# Will rising RAM prices cause the next Video Game Crash?

![Call of duty game](content/call-of-duty.png)


[braindump]
During a recent class discussion, someone asked if rising RAM prices might stifle the technical evolution of gaming. 

The fear is that if we can’t keep pushing the graphical ceiling, the industry will stagnate.

My response? If the survival of our medium depends solely on the next Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty selling a 'bajillion' copies to break even on their hardware-hungry budgets, then perhaps the industry needs to fail. 

If we are so hyper-focused on the 'arms race' of technical specs that we ignore the creative evolution happening in indie space, then we as a culture are looking at the wrong markers.

Indie games creates diversity of the art form - always has been.

# How do we find these new classics?

- **Level 1: The Preservationists**
- Level 2: The Iterators
- Level 3: The Impressionists

Games that are inspired by the classics and keeping the genre alive. Made by fans, who pushed the genre in a new direction or made their own twist. 

[braindump]
So how do we find these new classics?

You don't have to go a mile deep. Below are games made by indie developers.

Let's talk about analogs, which I consider -- "Level 1: The Preservationists" .
These are games that are inspired by the classics and keeping the genre alive. Made my fans, who pushed the genre in a new direction or made their own twist.

Finally, you're now at Level 3: The Impressionists. 
In the art world, this was a art movement that shifted painting towards personal expression. They are the games that we made because the DEVELOPER wanted to will them into existence. They weren't chasing after a fad. They made it for the love of gaming, may it be because of a nostalgic memory, or avant-garde.

# The Golden Age is right now

- We look back in time with rose-color glasses at the cream of the crop.
- But the Golden Age of Gaming isn't in the past. It's right now.
- In front of us is the unmapped territory.
- If you dig pass the algorithm, past the front page, you might the gems that will define the next generation.
- And a decade from now, during a future Video Game Studies class or Retro Gaming Expo, some fresh-faced gamers will be wearing that game as a T-shirt, all thanks to you.


[braindump]
We spent a lot of time in this class looking at the past with nostalgic rose-color glasses. We cherry picked the cream of the crop across history. 

But -- we have been standing on the shoulder of giants - giants who spend years digging not just discover gems hidden in the rubble, but to broadcast it to the world that this game deserves recognition.

The Golden age of Gaming isn't in the past - it's right now. We have more "unmapped territory" than any generation before us. If you dig pass the algorithm, past the games on the front page of your social media platform, you might find a gem. And that gem may just hit blockbuster status, all thanks to you.

And decade from now, in a future Video Game Studies or Retro Gaming Expo, when some fresh-face gamers are wearing that game as a T-shirt, it was because you helped shape the culture.
